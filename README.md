# Docker Stop Script

This Python script stops all Docker containers using the `sudo docker kill` command and prints the output along with the current Docker processes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anees0786/stop_your_docker
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python docker_script.py
    ```

3. View the script output and the current Docker processes.

Note: Ensure that you have Docker installed and configured on your system, and you have the necessary permissions to run Docker commands.
